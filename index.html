        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my personal website! I am a student with a passion for Computer Science. I have experience in Python, Java, HTML, and Javascript. In my spare time, I mostly play Microsoft Solitaire Collection and Microsoft Sudoku. I'm currently trying to get a year of free Premium Solitaire with my Microsoft Rewards and don't plan on stopping. My most puzzling subject is currently Calculus because I don't really understand some concepts but I'm working on improving that with my Calculus teacher. My most interesting class is Practicum in Computer Science and my second most interesting class is Business Information Management II. In the future, I aspire to either become a web developer because of how interesting the process of making a website like this one is or become a software developer. I've dabbled a little bit into the basic world of App Developement and App Design which is what got me interested in Software Development. Due to the nature of how rapidly the technological world is advancing and the amount of competition for Computer Science programs, I am focusing on trying to enroll at the University of Texas at Dallas for Software Engineering. Overall, I want to keep studying Computer Science since it gives me a reason to keep learning and I have a lot of fun when I look at anything related to the field. Feel free to look at my page and contact information</p>
